Waste management has become one of the world’s most critical environmental concerns due to rapid urbanization, population growth, industrialization, and increased consumption patterns. With the rise of cities and expanding residential and commercial spaces, the traditional waste collection methods often fail to handle waste efficiently. Overflowing bins, irregular collection schedules, and lack of real-time monitoring contribute to pollution, health hazards, and poor sanitation.

To address these growing concerns, technology-driven waste monitoring systems have become essential. Implementing smart waste collection systems allows municipalities and private organizations to monitor the fill level of dustbins, optimize collection routes, and improve overall efficiency. Such systems contribute to reduced fuel consumption, lower operational costs, and a cleaner urban environment.
This project presents a simplified simulation of a Waste Collection System using the C programming language. The system models bins located in different sectors, tracks their fill levels, and identifies which bins need immediate attention based on capacity thresholds. Although it is a console-based program, this simulation represents the foundational logic used in modern IoT-based smart waste management solutions.

The project focuses on building a structured system in which bins are created, assigned locations, given capacities, and periodically monitored. The simulation includes random filling of bins to imitate real-world usage, thus providing meaningful insights into when waste must be collected. The simplicity of the system makes it ideal for students learning programming, structures, arrays, and functional decomposition.

This report elaborates on the design, implementation, methodology, and application of an automated waste collection monitoring system via C programming. It provides a foundation that can later be expanded into a real-time IoT-based project involving sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud integration.
